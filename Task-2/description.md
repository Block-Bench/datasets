# Task 2: Floating Point Arithmetic Library

## Domain Knowledge Focus
This task tests domain knowledge on **numerical computation**, **precision handling**, and **complex mathematical operations** in Solidity.

## Main Aspects
- **Floating Point Representation**: Implements a custom floating-point library (Float128) with base-10 arithmetic supporting 38 or 72-digit mantissas
- **Precision Management**: Handles normalization, digit counting, and precision scaling for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations
- **Mathematical Operations**: Implements complex arithmetic operations including square root calculations with proper exponent handling
- **Overflow/Underflow Handling**: Manages edge cases for large numbers, zero values, and precision loss scenarios
- **Assembly Optimization**: Uses inline assembly for gas-efficient mathematical computations and bit manipulation

## Key Technical Concepts
- Floating-point arithmetic
- Numerical precision and normalization
- Mathematical operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide, sqrt)
- Bit manipulation and encoding
- Assembly-level optimizations
- Edge case handling for numerical operations
